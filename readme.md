Basic Image Editor is a very basic Image processing interface created based on python to perform some basic image processing operations 
like Histogram Equalisation, Gamma Correction, Blurring etc. The Interface for Basic Image Editor is made using tkinter library
from python. It uses PIL library to load, save and display Images on the Interface. Libraries math,numpy and cv2(openCv) are used for implementing 
the image processing techniques. 

"Interface.py" contains the basic code to build the GUI Interface. "transform.py" contains the code to all the image processing transformations
